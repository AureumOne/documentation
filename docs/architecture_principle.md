> The foundational design constraint that prevents systemic concentration of control.

Aureum One is built on a single, non-negotiable architectural principle:

**No single party may control more than one critical layer of the system.**

This principle exists to eliminate **concentration risk, discretionary abuse, and single points of failure**.

The system is intentionally designed to remain **institutionally predictable, auditable, and non-discretionary**.
