## Entity Governance

> Corporate governance structure ensuring institutional continuity and separation of powers.

This document defines the governance structure applicable to Aureum as a legal and organizational entity.

Aureum operates under a formal governance framework designed to ensure **institutional continuity, accountability, and separation of powers**.

Strategic oversight is exercised through a governing body with **fiduciary responsibility** over the entity, **distinct from day-to-day operations**.

Operational execution is delegated to management under defined mandates and internal controls.

**No single individual exercises unilateral control** over:
- strategic direction
- governance rule definition
- system-critical decisions
- evidentiary integrity

Material governance decisions are subject to **collective oversight, documented resolutions, and internal recordkeeping**.

This structure is designed to align Aureum with institutional expectations of governance without centralizing discretionary power.
