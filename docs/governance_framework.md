> Institutional-grade controls ensuring accountability, traceability, and non-discretionary execution.

Aureum One implements governance controls commonly found in regulated financial institutions.

These include **dual control**, the **four-eyes principle**, **separation of duties**, explicit decision authority, immutable audit trails, and **non-overrideable rules**.

**No single user, role, or entity may initiate, approve, execute, and evidence the same critical action.**
