## Business Continuity

> Ensuring client asset ownership persists regardless of Aureum's operational status.

Aureum is designed to ensure **continuity of client asset ownership independent of platform availability**.

In the event of service interruption, suspension, or permanent discontinuation:

- **client ownership of physical gold remains unaffected**
- **custody arrangements remain valid and enforceable**
- **execution venues continue to operate independently**

Aureum **does not act as a gatekeeper to asset access**.

**No asset, account, or legal right becomes inaccessible** due to Aureum's operational status.

This design ensures that Aureum **cannot become a single point of systemic dependency**.
