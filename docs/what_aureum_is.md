> Defining the institutional identity and operational boundaries of Aureum One.

Aureum One is a **non-custodial institutional infrastructure** for physical gold.

Aureum One operates as a **neutral orchestration and governance layer** that sits above existing custody and execution rails in the physical gold market.

Aureum One **does not sell gold, custody gold, hold client assets, execute trades, intermediate transactions, or make investment or economic decisions**.

The underlying asset is always fully allocated physical gold, held with independent, professional third-party custodians under their own regulatory regimes.

Aureum One **never touches assets, never controls custody accounts, and never has signing authority** over client funds or metals.

Its sole role is to **govern, authorize, and evidence institutional-grade flows** across independent counterparties.
