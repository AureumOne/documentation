## Growth & Regulatory Posture

> Scaling operations without altering regulatory classification or systemic footprint.

Aureum's growth does not alter its regulatory posture by design.

Scale does not introduce:
- asset aggregation
- balance sheet exposure
- settlement responsibility
- market intermediation

Operational growth increases evidentiary volume, not systemic risk.

Should regulatory classification thresholds be approached in any jurisdiction, Aureum commits to proactive assessment and structural adjustment.

Growth is governed to preserve institutional neutrality and compliance.
