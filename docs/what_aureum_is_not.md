> Explicit exclusions to prevent misclassification and ensure regulatory clarity.

For absolute clarity, Aureum One is **not**:

- **a custodian**
- **a broker-dealer**
- **a bullion house**
- **a trading venue**
- **an investment platform**
- **a marketplace**
- **a wallet provider**
- **a financial intermediary**

Aureum One **does not aggregate balances, does not pool assets, and does not rehypothecate gold**.

Custodians and execution venues remain **balance-sheet sovereign** at all times.
