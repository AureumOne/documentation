## Incident & Exception Handling

> How failures are anticipated, governed, and evidenced without remediation authority.

Incidents trigger **workflow freezes, evidence generation, and escalation**.

Exceptions require **explicit approval and full evidentiary traceability**.

Aureum One **governs impact but does not remediate third-party failures**.
