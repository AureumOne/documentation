## Liability & Accountability

> Defining the boundaries of Aureum One's responsibility and counterparty obligations.

Aureum One's liability is **strictly limited to the correct operation of governance and evidence mechanisms**.

Aureum One **is not liable for custody, execution, settlement, or third-party compliance failures**.

Each counterparty **remains fully liable for its own regulated activities**.

**No fiduciary responsibility is assumed by Aureum One.**
