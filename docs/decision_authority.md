> How authority is distributed, validated, and enforced across institutional workflows.

All institutional actions follow a **strict separation**.

Requests are initiated by authorized roles.

Approvals are validated by **independent authority**.

Execution is performed by external counterparties.

Evidence is **sealed automatically** by the system.

Aureum One **never collapses these roles**.
