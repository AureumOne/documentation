## Jurisdictional Anchoring

> Legal presence for institutional accountability without centralizing financial activity.

Aureum operates through **legally established entities in defined jurisdictions**.

Each entity operates within its local legal and regulatory framework and fulfills its applicable corporate obligations.

Jurisdictional presence is designed to support:
- **legal enforceability**
- **contractual clarity**
- **regulatory dialogue when required**

**No Aureum entity performs regulated financial activities** by design.

Jurisdictional structure **does not alter Aureum's non-custodial, non-intermediary posture**.

Legal anchoring exists to provide **institutional accountability, not to centralize financial activity**.
