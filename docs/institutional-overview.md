Aureum One operates through a multi-layered institutional architecture:

- Real Asset Layer: Swiss-vaulted gold,
- Operational Layer: regulated entity responsible for onboarding, gold management, and accounting,
- Digital Settlement Layer: XRPL tokenization infrastructure.

Each layer is segregated to minimize risk and enhance auditability.
