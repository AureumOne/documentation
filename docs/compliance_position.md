> Aureum One's regulatory posture and the allocation of compliance responsibilities.

Aureum One is **jurisdiction-agnostic** by design.

It **does not hold client funds, custody assets, or intermediate transactions**.

**Compliance obligations remain with custodians, execution venues, and onboarding entities.**

Aureum One's role is **limited to governance and evidence**.
