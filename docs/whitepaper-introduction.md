Gold has remained the world's most trusted long-term store of value. Yet traditional access routes impose significant friction: operational complexity, slow settlement, high custody costs, and limited liquidity.

Conversely, digital markets introduced speed and programmability but lacked trust, often suffering from weak custody, unverifiable backing, and governance failures.

**Aureum One merges these two worlds** by combining:

- Swiss-vaulted allocated gold,
- Institutional governance with independent oversight,
- Transparent 1:1 tokenization on the XRPL settlement ledger.

The result is a secure, audit-ready infrastructure enabling global access to physical gold with digital efficiency.
