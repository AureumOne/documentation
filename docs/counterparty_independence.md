## Counterparty Independence

> Preserving direct client relationships with custodians and execution venues.

All client assets remain under the control of **independent, professional counterparties**.

Custodians and execution venues maintain direct legal relationships with clients.

Aureum **does not intermediate**, replace, or supersede these relationships.

Clients retain enforceable rights against custodians and execution venues irrespective of Aureum’s involvement.

This structure preserves counterparty sovereignty and ensures asset continuity at all times.
