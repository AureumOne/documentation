> Structural separation ensuring no single entity controls custody, execution, governance, and evidence.

Aureum One separates the system into **four independent layers** by design.

### Custody Layer
Physical gold is held by professional third-party custodians under their own legal, regulatory, and insurance frameworks.

Aureum One **has no access to vaults, metal, or custody accounts**.

### Execution Layer
Trades are executed by independent bullion houses or execution venues on their own platforms.

Pricing, liquidity, and execution risk **remain entirely outside Aureum One**.

### Governance Layer
Aureum One enforces **non-discretionary governance rules**, including approval requirements, authorization sequencing, role separation, and escalation paths.

### Evidence Layer
Every governed event generates **immutable, append-only evidence** designed for external audit and regulatory review.
