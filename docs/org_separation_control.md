## Organizational Separation

> Preventing concentration of control through structural independence of ownership and operations.

Aureum maintains **strict separation between ownership, governance, and operational execution**.

Founders, shareholders, and strategic sponsors **do not exercise operational control by default**.

Operational roles are assigned based on **function and mandate, not ownership**.

Control mechanisms exist to prevent:
- concentration of authority
- operational override
- unilateral governance changes

Critical system parameters are **not subject to individual discretion** and require governed processes to modify.

This separation ensures that Aureum remains **institutionally governed rather than personality-driven**.
